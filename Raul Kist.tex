\section{Publications}
\cventry{2010}{ViCOS - Virtual Cluster Orchestration System}{CLCAR - Latin American Conference on High Performance Computing}{ISBN 978-85-7727-252-5}{}
{
An environment aware load balancing virtual cluster system that coordinates virtual machines that offer some service (HPC, SOA, etc) in a failover cluster, making a multipurpose environment which the main goal is to reduce the wasting of the infrastructure's computational potential. 
%ViCOS applies cloud computing concepts to high performance compute to ensure a flexible, economic and reliable environment for performing tasks demanding high performance.\\
%In order to do that, it uses the available idle machines of the environment, occupying them with virtual machines on demand and adapting to resources changes: if a host is to be used for other purposes, the system migrates the VMs to another host, so the task isn't interrupted and can continue elsewhere.\\
%Therefore, the physical resources are managed without work load interruption, and the system fits itself to the environment, automatically expanding and contracting based on resource demand, focusing in both performance increase and energy savings.
